# awesome-ui

I'm using this to test out some best practices. 
Vue, Nuxt, Composition API, Fetching, Caching, API State Management and Animations
## useFetch
Gets fetch results including fetch state
Component location: `src/components/MyComponent.vue`

## useSWR
Gets fetch results with caching out of the box.
Component location: `src/MyCachedComponent.vue`

## useSwerv

Gets fetch results with caching and fetch state out of the box using a custom composable called `useSwerv` for shorter and more concise code.

Component location: 
`src/components/BetterCachedComponent.vue`
`composables/useSwerv.ts`
`composables/useSwrvState.ts`
